\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I wish to thank my supervisor, Professor Ivan Baji{\'c}, for his guidance in the course of this project. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to study deep learning further and to contribute to a project at SFU's Multimedia Lab. Prof. Baji{\'c}'s clear explanations and insight were key to me assimilating the concepts in this project and me developing the proposed tensor completion method.

Many thanks to Dr. Robert A. Cohen for kindly agreeing to be my second committee member and for providing many insightful comments on this work.

I wish to thank all members of the Multimedia Lab for their valuable questions and suggestions provided during the group's weekly online meeting.

I wish to thank ComputeCanada for providing me access to the High Performance Computing cluster \textit{Cedar} and \textit{Graham} during the course of this project. Without their resources, it would have been impossible to complete this project in a reasonable amount of time.

It was certainly a challenge to do an entire research project remotely during the Covid pandemic. This challenge was made much less difficult by my partner Daksha. Thank you for your support and patience.
